Let's see if I remeber how this works.
Also, VSCode is awesome so far!
I could use this file to keep practicing the git commands along with some useful 
shortcuts for VSCode.

GIT commands : 
23.04.23
    git log
    git add <file_name>
    git commit
    git push (gotta check this one again)
23.04.23 - second
    git commit -m "Comment" : to comment the commit on Git/GitHub
    
VSCode shortcuts :
23.04.23
    code <file_name> (or just code to open VSCode)
    CTRL+"+" : open new Bash
    CTRL+"`" : open terminal / go to editor

This should be very useful!
p.s. I have also changed my keyboard layout to UK standar QUERTY just to get more
used to having all the useful keys available at all times.
